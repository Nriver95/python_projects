# python_projects
 
A repository containing all of my python projects with The Tech Academy.

The folders and assignments in this repository demonstrate various applications of python from the most basic use to defining functions and calling them in the console to utilizing modules like tkinter and sqlite3.

Projects of note that use multiple concepts learned in the python include the File Transfer Gui project, which demonstrates the use of importing modules and using them to create a gui that allows a user to transfer files from one repository to another. 

Another project the Phonebook project which uses tkinter and sqlite3 to create a gui that allows a user to add or remove records into a database.  Users can add information, update information, and delete information which is then applied to a database in the back-end without. The buttons are simple in function and have confirmation windows that pop up as well.
